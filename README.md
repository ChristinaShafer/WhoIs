# WhoIs
Hi! I'm Christina Shafer and you've found my github repository.  I have included my current resume and a few of my favorite projects from my Computer Science coursework at De Anza College in Cupertino, CA.  All the work listed is my own and is presented here as an example of my coding style.  The C++ projects are some of my earlier work while the Java and Python are more recent. All coursework is from the past 3 years.
In addition to courses at De Anza, I'm currently taking my first class (Software Analysis and Test) at Georgia Tech in pursuit of a masters degree in Computer Science. Georgia Tech's online masters of science in computer science (OMSCS) is structured to accomodate fully-employed students.  I am currently on a career break, however, I anticipate that my graduate studies would benefit any future employer and would not interfere with my ability to work full-time.
When I am not in class or working on an assignment, I love cheering on my daughter's volleyball team, meeting up with friends or planning fantastic vacations.
