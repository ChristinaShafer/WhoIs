# WhoIs
Hi! I'm Christina Shafer and you've found my github repository.    

I have included my current resume and a few of my favorite projects from my Computer Science coursework at De Anza College in Cupertino, CA.  All the work listed is my own.  The C++ projects are some of my earlier work while the Java and Python are more recent. All coursework is from the past 3 years.    

I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Due to the GA Tech honor code, I am unable to post the code for my graduate classes in a public repository.  If you are a potential employer and would like to see my Machine Learning, Android or Software Testing code, please send me an email and I can add you to my private repository. Here's my email address: Christina.J.Shafer@gmail.com.  

Georgia Tech's online masters of science in computer science (OMSCS) is structured to accomodate fully-employed students.  I am currently on a career break, however, I anticipate that my graduate studies would benefit any future employer and would not interfere with my ability to work full-time.  

When I am not in class or working on an assignment, I love cheering on my daughter's volleyball team, meeting up with friends or planning fantastic vacations.
